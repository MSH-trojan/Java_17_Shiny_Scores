Write a Java program that prints the following output. 
Note that the numbers shown in the output should not be hardcoded (should not be written manually when printing), you should declare an integer variable, ask 
the user to give you lab and bonus marks, and then calculate the total and print the numbers accordingly.
You should also use “escape sequences” as well when printing out these drawings.
The student info should be entered by the user.
The image of what the output should look like is provided.
